Below are some projects that are being actively worked on.  Please fork me if anything interests you...I would totally fork you.\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n\r\n## brazenhead\r\n[brazenhead](https://github.com/leandog/brazenhead) is a low-level driver for Android applications.  [brazenhead](https://github.com/leandog/brazenhead) allows you to instrument any application using a very simple json API with very little setup.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install brazenhead\r\n```\r\nAfter this, the only thing that [brazenhead](https://github.com/leandog/brazenhead) requires is to know some information about the application you are trying to instrument.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# tell brazenhead where your application is\r\nserver = Brazenhead::Server.new \"path/to/your/app.apk\"\r\n\r\n# start the activity that you'd like to instrument\r\nserver.start \"SomeActivity\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## gametel\r\n[gametel](https://github.com/leandog/gametel) is a higher-level abstraction around android cucumber drivers (in particular, [brazenhead](https://github.com/leandog/brazenhead)).  gametel provides for a page-object pattern around lower-level cucumber drivers for Android.  This allows for you to write very simple abstractions to instrument your Android applications.\r\n\r\n### Defining a screen\r\nTo define a screen, simply use some of [gametel's](https://github.com/leandog/gametel) default accessors to define the controls that you have on your activity.  Here is an example of a login screen page's definition.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass LoginPage\r\n  include Gametel\r\n\r\n  text(:username, :index => 0)\r\n  text(:password, :index => 1)\r\n  button(:login, :text => 'Login')\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it!  The only thing left is to utilize your newly defined page-object in your step definitions.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\non(LoginPage) do |page|\r\n  page.username = 'levi'\r\n  page.password = 'secret'\r\n  page.login\r\nend\r\n```"}
